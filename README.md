QAP# 2 - Semester 3 Full Stack JavaScript(Node.js)

This QAP is a multi-route http server that displays html files and makes use of events.
The QAP uses the following four core modules; http, events, filesystem, and console. 
There has been no use of npm packages such as express.
Tasks #1: Build a multi-route http server.
Task #2: Read html files from a views folder displayed to the requesting browser.
Task #3: identify events to capture and write them to the console.
BONUS tasks: 
User Story 1: As a system administrator I would like to have the system create disk files with logged events so I can review how the system has been behaving through time.
Steps: enhance the event logging to console so it also writes files to disk. Be sure to have good folder and file management. Logging to a single file is not a good idea. Log to daily files. Make sure the system creates a new file every day.
User Story 2: As a user I would like to have a route (web page) that provides useful daily information like news, weather, films, etc. 
Steps: Search NPM for packages that provide daily or weekly information. Install the package and display information using response.write().
